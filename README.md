## React - Webpack

This application has no use for visitors, it is a react-application where I used to set up manually webpack and its dependencies.

## What I learned

I learned how to set up **webpack** and **react-create-app manually**. Nontheless, I used **NPM** to manage and install all the dependencies I needed to successfully run my app.
